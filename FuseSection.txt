### FuseSection - Create a fuselage template using sections

This node group produces a simple fuselage shape using up to ten section shapes. Each of the section shapes are curves representing half of the fuselage sections at diffent locations. The section shapes can be relocated as objects as required to match a plan. It's the vertex/control point location relative to the origin that's important. The node group incudes a final subdivision surface node to allow smoothing.

The node group assumes that we are working in  millimetres, and that the nose of the fuselage is facing in the negative Y direction.

Parameters

Resolution - The number of vertices for each section, which controls the lateral resolution
Sections - The number of sections to be used, between 2 and 10.
SubD - Subdivision surface levels to be applied at the end
Y_Tail/Z_Tail - The X and Z locations for the single tail vertex
Sectionxx - The curve objects that define the section shapes
Yxx - The Y location of the section.
Y_Nose/Z_Nose - The X and Z locations for the single nose vertex

### Control Horn - Parametrically create a control horn

This node group creates a simple control horn

Parameters:

* Pad_x_mm - the width of the pad that glues to the control surface
* Pad_y_mm - the depth of the pad that glues to the control surface
* Thickness_mm - the thickness of both the mounting pad and the control horn
* Height_mm - the of the control horn (from control surface to top hole)
* Tip_y_mm - the depth of the control horn at the tip
* Hole_dia_mm - the diameter of the hole for the control linkage
* Hole_space_mm - the spacing between the centre point of each additional hole
* Hole_count - the number of holes
