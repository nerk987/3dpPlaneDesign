Youtube Overview (For the Blend File, not the addon...):https://youtu.be/w0Qn-hiX6Dg. Full tutorial coming soon

## Introduction
This is a blender file containing a number of design tools using Blender's Geometry Nodes.

## Installation
Download the zip file, and extract the 3dpPlaneDesign_2_14.blend file. Open it up and start designing a plane.

Alternatively you can append collections for a Wing, TailPlane, Fin, or Fuselage into your blend file. 

### Geometry node Tools:
* Parametric wing, tailplane and fin design with
    * Leading and trailing edges follow spline
    * Spline adjustable twist
    * Spline adjustable airfoil interpolation
    * Spline ajustable thickness
* Custom rib generation with structual holes
* Servo and servo bay
* Carbon Spar
* Spline base glider fuselage template
* Bulkhead based fuselage template

### Addons
* Import an airfoil from DAT file
* Export wing to xFlr5

### Other
* Aileron/Elevator/Rudder cutters
